## ðŸš€ Setting up

To utilize SQL analysis for conducting sales data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Launch your preferred SQL client and connect with the database where you have imported the sales data.

2. Familiarize yourself with the SQL scripts available in the repository. These scripts encompass different facets of sales data analysis, including data cleansing, segmentation, and RFM analysis.

3. Employ the SQL queries within your SQL client to carry out the desired analysis.

4. Evaluate the outcomes and extract valuable insights from the sales data.

## ðŸ“Š RFM Analysis
RFM analysis is used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It involves evaluating three key dimensions:

* <b>Recency(R):</b> Measures the time elapsed since the customer's last purchase. Customers who made recent purchases are more likely to be engaged and responsive.
* <b>Frequency(F):</b> Measures the number of purchases made by a customer over a specific period. Frequent customers are often more valuable to the business.
* <b>Monetary Value(M):</b> Measures the total value of purchases made by a customer. Customers with higher monetary value contribute more to the business revenue.
  
By analyzing these dimensions, RFM analysis assigns scores to each customer. It categorizes them into different segments such as Loyal Customers, Active (Customers who buy often & recently, but at low price points), Potential Customers, New Customers, and Lost Customers.
